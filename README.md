# 3D_Face_Reconstrction
I built this out of my personal interst. This program reconstructs a 3D face model from a single front-face image with the help of C++, QT, openGL, eos/dlib libraries and surrey face model. 

Libraries:
https://github.com/patrikhuber/eos
http://dlib.net

Here is the face landmark detection part. By selecting 68 landmarks, a face could be identified and located in the image.

Given the input sample photo:

By running face detection module, th program identified the front face and its location.
